Studebaker&#169 was first out of the gate with a freshly styled lineup in 1947,<br> 
beating the GM, Ford and Chrysler competition that wouldn’t have truly new <br>
cars to offer until 1949. Those 1947 Studebakers—styled by Raymond Loewy‘s team,<br> 
then including Holden Kato and Virgil Exner—would spark trends with their integral <br>
front fenders and wraparound rear glass. Their basic design remained in production <br>
through 1949, the last year Studebaker used a conventional grille design, <br>
before 1950-’51’s controversial “bullet nose” styling made the scene.<br>
<section>
 The 1949 lineup was largely carried over, and included the low-priced <br>
 Champion and premium Commander, both offered in Deluxe and Regal Deluxe<br> 
 trims and both with six-cylinder engines. Prices ranged from $1,588 for <br> 
 a three-passenger Champion Deluxe coupe to $2,467 for a Commander Regal Deluxe<br> convertible,the rough equivalents today of $15,900-$24,700. In this double-sided <br>
 four-panel foldout brochure, Studebaker was keen to emphasize its long 
 <br>history(97&nbspyears!) and multi-generational family workers, which were <br>
 also stressed in the firm’s print advertisements.
