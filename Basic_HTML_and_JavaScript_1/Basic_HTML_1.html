		Studebaker entered the automotive business in 1902 with electric vehicles and in 1904 with gasoline vehicles, all sold under the name "Studebaker Automobile Company". Until 1911, its automotive division operated in partnership with the Garford Company of Elyria, Ohio, and after 1909 with the <u>E-M-F Company.</u> The first gasoline automobiles to be fully manufactured by Studebaker were marketed in August 1912.[2]:p231 Over the next 50 years, the company established a reputation for good quality and reliability.[3]
