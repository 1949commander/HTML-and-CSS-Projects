		<p><h2> Introduction</h2></p>
			<p> <b>Nash Motors Company</b> was an American automobile manufacturer based in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in the United States from 1916 to 1937. From 1937 to 1954, Nash Motors was the automotive division of the Nash-Kelvinator Corporation. Nash production continued from 1954 to 1957 after the creation of American Motors Corporation.
			</p>
		<p><h2> Brief History</h2></p>
			<p>
			Nash pioneered some important innovations; in 1938 they debuted the heating and ventilation system which is still used today, unibody construction in 1941, seat belts in 1950, a US built compact car in 1950, and muscle cars in 1957.
			</p>
		<p><h2> Biggest Selling Model</h2></p>
			<p><h3> 1949 Nash "Airflyte"</h3></p>
				<p>
				Nash-Kelvinator president George Mason believed in fiscal responsibility, but also wanted to be "a bit daring, bold, and out of the mainstream" by making "cars noticeably different from those of the mainline Big Three producers." Nash's Vice President of Engineering, Nils Eric Wahlberg, had access to a wind tunnel during the war and believed that future cars should take advantage of aerodynamics to achieve many benefits. The company used revenue from its wartime contracts to develop a car that was "the most streamlined form on the road" and lower by 6 inches (152 mm) than the previous designs. Mason was also a convert to build a large aerodynamically clean family car for the postwar market and even championed the design's enclosed wheels as a bold innovative feature. The resulting car reflected aerodynamic notions of its era, with a rear half resembling the 1935 Stout Scarab.

		<p><h2> Introduction</h2></p>
			<p> <b>Packard</b> was an American luxury automobile marque built by the Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan, United States. The first Packard automobiles were produced in 1899, and the last Detroit-built Packard in 1956, when they built the Packard Predictor, their last concept car.
			</p>
		<p><h2> Brief History</h2></p>
			<p>
			Packards had large, square bodies that suggested an elegant solidity, and the company was renowned for its hand-finished attention to detail. In the 1930s, however, the superior resources of General Motors and the success of its V-16 engine pushed Cadillac past Packard as the premier luxury car in America. Packard diversified by producing a smaller, more affordable model, the One Twenty, which increased the company’s sales. The coming of World War II halted consumer car production in the United States. In the postwar years, Packard struggled as Cadillac maintained a firm hold on the luxury car market and the media saddled the lumbering Packard with names like “bathtub” or “pregnant elephant.”

		<p><h2> Biggest Selling Model</h2></p>
			<p><h3> 1949 Packard Deluxe 8</h3></p>
				<p>
				The 1949-1950 Packard Super DeLuxe Eight was the reason why Custom Eight sales dropped so drastically after 1948. The Super shared the grille style and wheelbase of the costlier Custom, and dealers could even supply its cloisonné-decorated hubcaps.
				</p>
				<p>
				The 1949-50 Customs were not as richly trimmed as the '48s, and the Super Deluxe's 327-cid straight eight was almost as smooth as the big 356 unit. No wonder many buyers saw little reason to pick the Custom and pay $700-900 more.
				<br>
				Pluses of the 1949-1950 Packard Super DeLuxe Eight:
				<br>
				<p>
				Custom Eight looks at a lower price still its biggest attraction
				Better performance than heavier Custom despite smaller engine
				Minuses of the 1949-1950 Packard Super DeLuxe Eight:
				<br>
				The ugliest period of Packard's post-war era (though customs looked better than lesser models)
				</p>
				<p>
				Production of the 1949-1950 Packard Super DeLuxe Eight:
				<br>
				1949 2-door/4-door sedans: 3,000 (estimated); convertibles: 685; lwb sedan/limo: 4
				1950: 2-door/4-door sedans: 2,000 (estimated); convertibles: 600
				Specifications of the 1949-1950 Packard Super DeLuxe Eight:
				Wheelbase, inches: 127.0/141.0
				Length, inches: 211.7/225.7
				Weight, pounds: 3,855-4,260 (lwb: 4,600-4,620)
				Price, new: $2,894-2,919 (lwb: $3,950-4,100)
